# DNS-Ping Monitoring with real data from my home
This project implement a nice monitoring of average response times of DNS resolvers based on [dnsping](https://dnsdiag.org/) in RRD databases and simple HTML pages with PNG graphs. With these information you can decide which DNS resolver to choose for performance reasons.  

‚ö†Ô∏è  In contrast to [https://github.com/thomasmerz/dnspingtest_rrd](https://github.com/thomasmerz/dnspingtest_rrd) this repo contains "real data" from my Linux server **at my home** (pushed nightly or on request).  

üìà **So all you have to do is: clone this repo and have a look on the HTML pages you are interested in:**  
- Dashboards with all DNS resolvers on a hourly/daily/weekly/monthly/yearly base or  
- all-in-one for each DNS resolver.  

üìà **Or use the direct links to my dashboards:**  
- [Dashboard for yesterday](https://thomasmerz.github.io/dnspingtest_rrd_ka/dashboard_day.html)
- [Dashboard for the last seven days](https://thomasmerz.github.io/dnspingtest_rrd_ka/dashboard_week.html)
- [Dashboard for the month](https://thomasmerz.github.io/dnspingtest_rrd_ka/dashboard_month.html)
- [Dashboard for the year](https://thomasmerz.github.io/dnspingtest_rrd_ka/dashboard_year.html)

‚ö†Ô∏è  All data is currently updated on a daily base at 3am.

‚ö†Ô∏è  If you want to know what the following **scripts** are doing and how to integrate into your **crontab**, please have a look in [https://github.com/thomasmerz/dnspingtest_rrd](https://github.com/thomasmerz/dnspingtest_rrd)!
